**Description**:

The weight of the dice is exactly the number at the top of it!

1 & 2 are light enough to float on the water.

4 & 5 & 6 are heavy so they can not climb the slopes.

5 are so heavy that it will break the wasteland(the earthy yellow block).

6 are even heavier so it can also make the grassland become wasteland!
